# Summary: 

These notebooks are a practical guide for backtesting some classical investment strategies for retail investors. 

Theses notebooks implement the fundamental tools that every retail investor should be aware of when investing in financial markets. They include: 

1. The mean variance approach for portfolio construction.
2. The calculations of nominal returns, inflation rates and real returns.
3. The calculations of relative periodic returns and the cumulative returns. The difference between the two is also shown during the implementation.
4. The implementation of a buy and hold strategy as a Class and the calculation of performance metrics, namely the Sharpe ration.
5. The implementation of a dollar cost averaging straetgy, also as a Class, and the calculation of the time weighted returns as an adjustment of the traditional definition of returns.
